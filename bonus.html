<h1>White Cheetah</h1>
<P>The cheetah is the fastest land animal in the world, reaching speeds of up to 70 miles <br>
    per hour. They can accelerate from 0 to 68 miles per hour in just three seconds. <br>
    Cheetahs are the only big cat that can turn in mid-air while sprinting.</P>
<p>Cheetahs are carnivores, so rely on meat for survival. Their diet is made up primarily <br>
    of smaller antelopes including springbok, steenbok, Thomsonâ€™s gazelle, impalas, and duiker. <br>
    Cheetahs will also feed on wildebeest calves and, occasionally, smaller animals including <br>
    rabbits, hares and birds.</p>
