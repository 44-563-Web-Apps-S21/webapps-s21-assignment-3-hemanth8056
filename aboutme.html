<title>My Favourite Super Hero</title>
<h1>Spider man</h1>
<p>On a school trip, Peter Parker, a high school senior, visits a Columbia University genetics lab, <br>
    where he is bitten by a genetically engineered "super spider" that escaped containment and <br>
    apparently falls ill after returning home. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn, scientist and owner of <br>
    Oscorp, tries to land a major military contract. He experiments on himself with an unstable <br>
    performance-enhancing chemical and goes berserk, killing his assistant.</p>
<p>The next morning, Peter discovers that he is no longer myopic and his body has metamorphosed <br>
    into a more muscular physique. At school, he discovers that he can shoot cobwebs from his <br>
    wrists and that his accelerated reflexes allow him to avoid injury during a confrontation <br>
    with bully Flash Thompson. Peter discovers that he has developed superhuman strength, the <br>
    ability to stick to surfaces, and an increased ability to sense danger.</p>
