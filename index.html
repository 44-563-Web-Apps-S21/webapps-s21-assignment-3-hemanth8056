<h3>Playing Cricket</h6>
<p><b>Cricket</b> is a sport which is played between two teams of eleven players each.<br>
   <b>One team, which is batting, tries to score runs</b> , while the other team is fielding,<br>
   and tries to prevent this. <b>Runs are scored by hitting the ball</b>, which is thrown by <br>
   a player from the fielding team to a player from the batting team, across the boundary, <br>
   or by the batting team's players running between two areas of the field called the <br>
   batsmen's grounds as many times as possible before the fielding team successfully hits <br>
   a wicket (set of sticks) in either of the grounds with the ball to get them out.</p>

<p>South India connects me with the exquisitely architectured ancient temples and the beautiful <br>
   setting where the South Indian women are seen in traditional silk sarees draped elegantly <br>
   and men wearing a white sarong like garment (Lungi or Mundu in Kerala) with white shirts are <br>
   laid-back and welcoming towards each other and the tourists. The palm-fringed canals, <br>
   spirituality, and pristine beaches are some of the reasons that make the discerning <br>
   travelers a chance to wander to the unfailing and unbeatable tranquility of the gorgeous <br>
   places in South India. So here is the list of top 4 tourist destinations that you can choose <br>
   to plan an interesting South India tour.</p>
