<h3>Playing Cricket</h6>
<p><b>Cricket</b> is a sport which is played between two teams of eleven players each.<br>
   <b>One team, which is batting, tries to score runs</b> , while the other team is fielding,<br>
   and tries to prevent this. <b>Runs are scored by hitting the ball</b>, which is thrown by <br>
   a player from the fielding team to a player from the batting team, across the boundary, <br>
   or by the batting team's players running between two areas of the field called the <br>
   batsmen's grounds as many times as possible before the fielding team successfully hits <br>
   a wicket (set of sticks) in either of the grounds with the ball to get them out.</p>
